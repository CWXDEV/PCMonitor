Repo to test and research getting systeminformation to use with a GUI.

# JavaScript
- Getting some of the information takes way too long imo, getting all the info can take 20seconds.
- The sheer time it can take has basically made me disregard this choice completely.

# C#
- Alot faster than JS, has the ability to "update" the info too.
